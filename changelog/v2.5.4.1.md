## Release v2.5.4.1

Hi all, this is a minor patch release that mostly focuses on accessibility. Since we follow semantic versioning, this should be a smooth upgrade with no breaking changes.

In addition, the theme docs website has a new canonical URL: <https://just-the-docs.com>. We've also retroactively published the theme docs website for version `v0.3.3` at <https://v0-3-3-docs.just-the-docs.com/>. Thank you to our GitHub sponsors for funding our domain name!

### Using Release `v0.5.2`

Users who have not pinned the theme version will be **automatically upgraded to `v0.5.2` the next time they build their site**.

To use this release explicitly as a remote theme:

```yml
remote_theme: just-the-docs/just-the-docs@v0.5.2
```

To use this version explicitly as a gem-based theme, pin the version in your `Gemfile` and re-run `bundle install` or `bundle update just-the-docs`:

```ruby
gem "just-the-docs", "0.5.2"
```

To use and pin a previous version of the theme, replace the `0.5.2` with the desired release tag.

### Bugfixes

## Release v0.5.1

Hi all, this is a very small minor patch release that has two small behavioral bugfixes: fixing a regression introduced in `v0.5.0` on Safari versions `<16.4` (broken media query), and the copy code button providing incorrect feedback in insecure browser contexts. This should be a smooth upgrade with no breaking changes.

As always, we'd love your feedback. [Open an issue](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs/issues) or [start a discussion](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs/discussions) for bug reports, feature requests, and any other feedback. Thanks for continuing to use Just the Docs!
